# simple-mamba
This repository contains a simple PyTorch implementation of the **Mamba** architecture for image classification on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. Mamba is a state space model (SSM) designed to model long-range dependencies efficiently â€” offering an alternative to Transformers in sequence-based vision tasks.
It includes training a model from scratch for image classification tasks.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Trainable Mamba-based classifier for CIFAR-10
- âœ… Clean and minimal PyTorch code
- âœ… Supports training from scratch
- âœ… Easily extendable to other vision tasks or datasets


## ðŸ§  What is Mamba?

[Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) is a Selective State Space Model introduced by Gu et al. (2023) for efficient sequence modeling. Unlike Transformers, Mamba avoids attention by using dynamic linear state-space operators with selective memory updates â€” enabling faster and scalable training, even in causal or streaming settings.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Install necessary dependencies:

This project requires Python â‰¥ 3.8 and PyTorch â‰¥ 1.12.

Install all required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install mamba-ssm causal-conv1d
```
If you encounter PyTorch version or compiler issues (e.g., during building mamba-ssm), use the following safer option:
```bash
pip install mamba-ssm causal-conv1d --no-build-isolation
```

### To Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marshajennifer/simple-mamba.git
cd mamba-cifar10
```
### Run the .ipynb file to train and test the model.

### Trained model is also uploaded in the repository.
```bash
mamba_cifar.pth
```
