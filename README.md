# simple-mamba
This repository contains a simple PyTorch implementation of the **Mamba** architecture for image classification on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. Mamba is a state space model (SSM) designed to model long-range dependencies efficiently â€” offering an alternative to Transformers in sequence-based vision tasks.
